**Impact of Child Trauma Training in Bolton: A Synthetic Control Analysis**

---

## 📝 Overview

In this analysis, we employ synthetic control methods to examine the impact of child trauma training in Bolton on student absence rates, persistent absence rates, suspension rates, and exclusion rates. By constructing a synthetic control group, we aim to estimate the counterfactual outcomes in the absence of the intervention, providing a robust evaluation of its effectiveness.
